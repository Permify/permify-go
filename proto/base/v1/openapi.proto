    description: "Permify is an open-source authorization service for creating and maintaining fine-grained authorizations across your individual applications and services. Permify converts authorization data as relational tuples into a database you point at. We called that database a Write Database (WriteDB) and it behaves as a centralized data source for your authorization system. You can model of your authorization with Permify's DSL - Permify Schema - and perform access checks with a single API call anywhere on your stack. Access decisions made according to stored relational tuples.";
